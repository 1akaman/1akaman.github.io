I am **Xinzhe Juan (隽昕哲)**, a senior undergraduate student studying Computer Science at the **University of Michigan** and **Shanghai Jiao Tong University** (dual-degree program).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **LLM**, **AI agents** and **AI for X (science, humanities, etc.)**. I'm currently work as a RA under the guidance of Professor Mengdi Wang at Princeton University.

I am actively seeking **PhD opportunities (Fall 2026)** in areas related to **LLM reasoning, AI agents, and AI for X**. If you are interested in collaborating, please feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:juanxz@umich.edu).
