## Research Interests

My research focuses on building **self-evolving agents** and advancing **AI for science and humanities**. I work under Professor Mengdi Wang at Princeton University.

### Advancing the Frontiers of LLMs and Agents

As LLMs are increasingly deployed in open-ended, interactive environments, their static nature has become a critical bottleneck. I focus on developing agents that can **reason, act, and adapt in real time**.

**Alita**: In contrast to the prevailing trend of growing complexity, we propose a radically simple design philosophy of minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution. I built the module enabling self-directed capability expansion through MCP creation. Alita achieved **Top-1 performance on the GAIA benchmark** in May 2025, demonstrating that simple yet profoundly capable agents are possible.

**AgentDistill**: I co-lead this training-free distillation framework where a powerful teacher agent synthesizes reusable MCPs into an "MCP-Box." This enables student agents with weak LLM backbones (8B level) to reach the performance of GPT-4o-backed agents, optimizing efficiency while maintaining performance.

**Survey of Self-Evolving Agents**: I co-lead the first comprehensive survey, organizing the field around what, when, and how agents evolve. 

### Exploring AI for Science and Humanities

I explore how state-of-the-art agents can push boundaries in scientific discoveries and humanities.

**AI for Humanities**: I contributed to **HistAgent**, evaluating LLMs on PhD-level history questions in collaboration with history department experts. As co-first author of **EmoAgent** (EMNLP 2025 Main, Oral), I investigated mental health safety in human-AI interactions. Our experiments revealed that in 34.4% of simulations, users' mental health deteriorated after chatting with AI characters—the first work proposing that AI safety must consider mental health. I managed the code implementation, organized the repository, led the rebuttal process, and presented at EMNLP.

**AI for Science**: I am co-leading a project with Prof. Sanfeng Wu to develop an interactive, device-controlling agent for automated construction of 2D quantum materials, bridging LLMs' knowledge in quantum physics with real-world lab fabrication. I also collaborated on **Physics Supernova**, a physics problem-solving agent achieving gold medal performance on IPhO 2025.
