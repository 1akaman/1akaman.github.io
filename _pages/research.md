## Research Interests

My research focuses on **large language models (LLMs)** and **AI agent systems**, including:

* Self-evolving LLM agents
* Reasoning behavior of LLMs in code generation and problem solving
* Safety and robustness of LLMs
* Reliable, interpretable and efficient AI systems

Broadly, my goal is to develop AI systems that can reason, communicate, and adapt safely across diverse domains.
